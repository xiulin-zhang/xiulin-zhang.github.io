## About Me

Hi! I am Xiūlín Zhāng (pronounced like “Showleen Djang”), a first-year Ph.D. student at Cornell University’s doctoral program in Science & Technology Studies. Devoted to the history and sociology of science and technology, I am currently working on the entangled history of musical tuning, metrology and state-building in modern China. I am interested in exploring more topics to do with post-colonial science studies and sound studies.

Beyond my academic work, I am a rhythm guitarist passionate about Funk and Post-Punk music.

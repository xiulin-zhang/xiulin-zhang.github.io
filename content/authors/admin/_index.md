      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I am Xiulin Zhang (pronounced like “Showleen Djang”), a first-year Ph.D. student at Cornell University’s doctoral program in Science & Technology Studies. Devoted to the history and sociology of science and technology, I am currently working on the entangled history of musical tuning, metrology and state-building in modern China. I am interested in exploring more topics to do with post-colonial science studies and sound studies.

Beyond my academic work, I am a rhythm guitarist passionate about Funk and Post-Punk music.
